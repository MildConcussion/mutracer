# Tests

```bash
npm test                                   # all tests
npm test -- tests/unit/geometry.test.ts    # one file
```

- `unit/`: scene primitives, geometry helpers, BVH construction, light and
  material packing, sampling, shader-cache keys, WGSL validity of generated
  shaders, renderer lifecycle and denoiser setup.
- `integration/`: loaders run on small in-memory fixtures.

Tests run in Node without a GPU. They check behavior and contracts, not image
quality. Check GPU output separately by rendering the examples, or a fixed
scene with a fixed sample count, before and after a change (see
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#checks)).

`npm run dev` also serves [`gpu/jnlm.html`](./gpu/jnlm.html). Open
`http://localhost:3001/tests/gpu/jnlm.html` in a browser with a real WebGPU
adapter. It runs the actual WebGPU and WebGL 2 denoising passes on deterministic
fixtures, checking noise reduction, bright and dark texture contrast, normal
detail, and coverage edges. These tests are separate from the Node test suite.

[`gpu/progressiveRendering.html`](./gpu/progressiveRendering.html) measures ten
preview/final round trips after warming both targets. It counts WebGPU
`createTexture` / `createBuffer`, or WebGL `createTexture` / `createFramebuffer`
with `?webgl`, and records `presentedTarget` / `presentedComplete` per frame.
Preview resolution is held fixed during this probe; adaptive preview rebuilding
is checked separately. The reusable `measureProgressiveSwitches` helper can also
be run against each example's scene and camera. HDR equivalence requires a
separate fixed-resolution, fixed-spp `render.converge` / `render.readPixels('hdr')`
comparison against pixels captured before a refactor.

[`gpu/thinPane.html`](./gpu/thinPane.html) checks window glass (thin panes) in a
black room on both backends (`?webgl` for WebGL 2) and reports `pass`: sun on
the floor through the pane against the open window times the pane's
transmittance at the sun's angle, a panel seen through it against the
transmittance at normal incidence, and a floor lit by an emissive panel through
it against the same glass rendered with the full BSDF (roughness 1e-4).

Use small generated fixtures; do not commit models or images for tests.

[`gpu/shaderSource.html`](./gpu/shaderSource.html) exposes
`shaderSourceTests.capture(layout, postProcess)` for before/after comparisons.
It uses four OpenPBR layer materials, four background configurations, Sobol
sampling with sequence offset 17 and 8 samples. Pass `true` for `postProcess`
to include bloom/JNLM output and 48×32 → 30×20 → 48×32 scratch reuse; append
`?webgl` to select WebGL 2. Capture results include HDR pixels, denoised pixels,
depth queries and renderer compilation diagnostics. Compare each backend and
layout against its own baseline.
