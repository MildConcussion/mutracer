# Changelog

All notable changes to MuTracer will be documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Smooth, untextured, thin-walled glass is a thin pane on WebGPU and WebGL 2: lights and the environment are sampled through it, so daylight reaches a room through its windows. See [window glass](docs/materials.md#window-glass).
- `userData.mutracerOpenPBR` accepts the base inputs `transmissionWeight`, `transmissionColor`, `specularRoughness`, `baseMetalness` and `specularIor`, so a `MeshStandardMaterial` can path-trace as glass while the live Three.js view keeps it unchanged.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-10-19

### Changed

- Installing the library no longer pulls in `webgpu-utils`.

### Fixed

- Adding untextured lights after a scene update works correctly on WebGPU and WebGL 2.
- WebGPU shadow catchers blend seamlessly into opaque flat backgrounds at receiver edges, including with bloom and HDR output.
- WebGPU OIDN denoising reduces colored artifacts around foreground silhouettes over shadow catchers with textured or translucent backgrounds.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-10-16

### Added

- WebGPU displacement supports `displacementBias` (default `0`) for signed height offsets in mesh-local units, including conversion from Three.js materials.

### Changed

- `displacementStepSize` now defaults to `0`, automatically using 1/32 of the absolute displacement height. Set `0.01` explicitly to retain the previous fixed step; smaller steps capture finer detail at a higher rendering cost.
- Converting a Three.js material without a displacement map now uses MuTracer's default height of `0.1` instead of Three.js's inactive default of `1`. Other configured heights are preserved.

### Fixed

- Editing displacement maps, image sources or height settings updates the rendered surface correctly, including meshes that share geometry.
- Displacement remains consistent when object transforms scale the mesh, including small displacement heights.
- WebGL 2 renders the original surface correctly when displacement settings are present; displacement requires WebGPU.
- Clicking or holding a stationary view with Three.js controls preserves accumulated samples and completed renders.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-14

### Changed

- Interactive previews adapt resolution to tracing, denoising and display latency.

### Fixed

- Denoised previews remain responsive and finish during continuous interaction, with stable transitions to the final render.
- Three.js camera controls settle reliably and account for elapsed time when damping.
- Animation and incremental geometry updates retain prepared BVHs.
- Shadow catcher denoising receives auxiliary albedo and normal guides on both WebGPU and WebGL 2, reducing color artifacts.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-14

### Added

- Progressive browser path tracing on WebGPU with a WebGL 2 fallback.
- Area, sphere, spot/IES, directional and environment lights with multiple importance sampling.
- OpenPBR 1.1 materials including coat, fuzz, thin film, transmission, subsurface and emission.
- Static BLAS construction in a Worker with the TypeScript binned SAH builder or optional TinyBVH WebAssembly, selectable `bvhLayout`, and instance-transform refits.
- OIDN denoising for final images and converging previews; bundled standard/small networks and an independent complete weights package.
- Three.js scene conversion and retained synchronization with THREESceneSync.
- Sobol, ZSobol and random sampling, deterministic offline rendering and adaptive sampling.
- Tone mapping, color grading, bloom, shadow catchers, transparent backgrounds and depth of field.
- API documentation, procedural examples and a viewer for exploring scenes and exporting images.
